## About the application

Psycheas is a type of problem-solving challenge where the goal is to determine who committed a crime or some other mysterious event.

The solver is given a set of clues that must be cobbled together in order to solve the mystery. However, he or she must be cautious **since hints are mixed together with dead ends**. The clues might come in the shape of witness accounts, tangible proof, or other sorts of information.

**These storylines have at least 5 clues, 2 dead ends and 1 solution(As per the requirement)**

The solver must carefully study each clue and apply logic and logical reasoning to eliminate probable suspects and restrict the list of viable solutions. This necessitates meticulous attention to detail as well as the capacity to critically evaluate each item of the¬†information offered.

The user is given several options to choose the answer from. **These options are designed in such a manner that will legitimately confuse the solver to arrive at a particular solution.**
Additionally, there is a ***5-minute timer*** that runs throughout the period. This will test the time management skills of the user. This timer plays a significant role in the calculation of accuracy. If the user is unable to answer question within the period, then the option which the solver has initially chosen will be auto-submitted and the results will be shown. In case the **solver hasn't chosen any answer**, it will be **automatically marked as incorrect**. 

### Calculation of accuracy and percentile

- Accuracy - The time and correct is taken from the frontend side and accuracy is calculated on the basis of that. For correct answer, a credit of 0.5 is multiplied with time. 0.1 incase it's wrong. Additional 50 points are awarded if it is correct.

- Percentile - If the user attempts **it correctly for the first time**, it gets 100 percentile else 0 incase it is incorrect. It is basically calculated on the basics of previous attempts and how many times was he correct. 

## **Ways to solve this problem**
Largely depends upon the storyline and various softskills of the solver such as problem-solving, critical thinking, deductive reasoning, and attention to detail.
